Looking at the full HTML, I need to find section 6 of 10 which would be the "Monday Big Box Promotion" section. However, the HTML provided appears to be incomplete and cuts off in the middle of a script tag. I cannot see the actual content sections or identify a "Monday Big Box Promotion" section from the provided HTML.

The HTML shown contains mostly head elements (meta tags, scripts, stylesheets) and appears to cut off before reaching the body content where the sections would be located.

Could you please provide the complete HTML that includes the body content with all 10 sections, so I can properly identify and convert section 6 (the Monday Big Box Promotion section)?
