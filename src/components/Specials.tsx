I cannot find a "Today's Deal Section" or section 5 of 10 in the provided HTML fragment. The HTML appears to be just the document head with meta tags, scripts, and stylesheets - it doesn't contain any body content or sections.

To properly convert the "Today's Deal Section," I would need the actual HTML content that contains:
- The section with class names, content, and structure
- Any div elements, text content, images, or other HTML elements that make up this section

Could you please provide the HTML content for the specific "Today's Deal Section" you'd like me to convert?
