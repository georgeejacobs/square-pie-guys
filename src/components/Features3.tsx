Looking at the HTML provided, I cannot locate a "Delivery & Rewards Benefits" section (section 7 of 10) in the content. The HTML appears to be incomplete and contains mainly the document head and some script elements, without the actual body content or sections.

Since I cannot find the specific section you're referring to, I'll provide a basic component structure:

```jsx
export default function Features3() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Section 7: Delivery & Rewards Benefits not found in provided HTML */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

To properly convert the section, I would need the complete HTML that includes the body content with all 10 sections, specifically the "Delivery & Rewards Benefits" section you mentioned.
