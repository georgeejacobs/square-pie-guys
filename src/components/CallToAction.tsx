I notice that the HTML provided is incomplete and cuts off in the middle. The HTML appears to be the full page head section, but I cannot locate the specific "Say Hi Call-to-Action" section (section 8 of 10) that you're asking me to convert.

The provided HTML fragment ends with:
```
"rollups":{"squarespace-announcement-bar":{"js":"//assets.squarespace.com/universal/scripts-compressed/announcement-bar-caefb69de8707954-min.en-US
```

To properly convert the Call-to-Action section, I would need the complete HTML that includes the actual body content with the section you want me to extract and convert. Could you please provide the complete HTML that includes the "Say Hi Call-to-Action" section?
