I need to see the actual HTML content to identify and convert the "Team Introduction Section" (section 4 of 10). The provided HTML appears to be only the document head and some script tags, but doesn't contain the body content with the actual sections.

Could you please provide the HTML content that includes the Team Introduction Section? I need to see the actual section content with its markup, classes, and structure to convert it properly to JSX.
