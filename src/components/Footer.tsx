Looking at the HTML, I cannot find a "Main Footer" section or any section 10 of 10 in the provided HTML content. The HTML appears to be incomplete and cuts off at the beginning with just the `<head>` section and some script tags. There is no `<body>` content or any footer sections visible in the provided HTML.

The HTML ends abruptly with:

```html
"rollups":{"squarespace-announcement-bar":{"js":"//assets.squarespace.com/universal/scripts-compressed/announcement-bar-caefb69de8707954-min.en-US
```

To convert the footer section, I would need the complete HTML that includes the actual footer content with its HTML structure, classes, and content. Could you please provide the complete HTML that includes the footer section you want converted?
